# üéÑ Advent of Code üéÑ

It's that time of the year again! Only a few days until Christmas. Chocolate makes you fat and lately there have been scandals of mineral oil in advent calendars each year. How about feeding our brains instead?

Each day we get to open a door with a puzzle to solve by code.

## üèÅ Goals üèÅ 

üêç Improve Python and explore the Python ecosystem (especially the [datascience stack](http://pydata.org/)) and improve understanding of the inner workings of Python. 

üñß Exchange ideas on the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode) and learn from other approaches as well.

### 2020
Finish AOC without restrictions. Consistency is key. Have fun while doing it. Don't aim for the leaderboard, it opens 5am and people are crazy fast anyways. Tinker with the Day class and possibly add some nifty utilities to make each day a little easier.

### 2019
Learn some OOP and build a reusable class for each day. Build tests with [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/), ideally trying some TDD to solve the problems. The examples give a great basis for small-scale tests and the input-file serve larger tests which can be added after the right solution was found.

### 2018
Get acquainted with Advent of Code and solve some of the puzzles in Python.
